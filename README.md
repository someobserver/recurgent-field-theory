# Recurgent Field Theory

A mathematical physics of consciousness.

## Abstract

Recurgent Field Theory treats semantic meaning as a mensurable phenomenon governed by field equations. In this space, accumulated semantic mass engenders gravitational-like effects to shape the formation and propagation of subsequent semantic structure. Conscious agents are described as bounded, geometric regions within this space, actively constructing and reconstructing reality through interpretation. Agent engagement with ideas continually reshapes the landscape of attractors. This avails a mathematical description of observer-dependent reality in which consciousness (1) emerges naturally, (2) experiences a forward temporal flow, and (3) exerts genuine causal influence on the surrounding space.

Semantic temporal flow operates bidirectionally: causal influence propagates forward from semantic mass concentrations as prior structure receives present re-interpretive influence. Present reinterpretation modifies the meaning of past events causing ideas to undergo phase transitions. Mass concentrations achieve autopoietic self-maintenance when exceeding threshold values of criticality. Wisdom fields and humility operators, both emergent, then constrain pathological recursive amplification.

The theory describes geometric signatures for twelve pathological dynamics spanning four distinct categories of three. Rigidity breakdowns emerge from over-constraint, fragmentation from the opposite. Runaway autopoiesis causes inflation pathologies, while deteriorations in observer interpretation reflect a holistic decoupling from objective reality.

Differential equations govern these twelve configurations to allow algorithmic detection and therapeutic intervention. Theorem 7 establishes computational realizability. PRISM, a working application, operates on 2000D manifolds, performing real-time geometric analysis of curvature tensors and recursive coupling relationships. Twelve detection algorithms identify the set of pathology classes across individual cognition and collective coordination.

Mathematical foundations for consciousness studies become apparent in this framework. It engages with existing work such as Integrated Information Theory (Tononi, 2004), as well as artificial intelligence safety and collective coordination dynamics. Formal agency metrics provide pathways for geometric pathology detection and therapeutic intervention. Constraint-based mechanisms dispense emergent tools for AI alignment with wisdom field regulation and humility operators. The field equations governing meaning can achieve mathematical precision comparable to those of established physical theories.

# Recurgent Field Theory

A mathematical physics of consciousness.

## Abstract

Recurgent Field Theory models meaning as a measurable field on a dynamic, semantic manifold. On this manifold, concentrations of semantic mass exert gravitational-like forces shaping the formation and propagation of subsequent structure. Conscious agents are bounded, geometric subregions within, interpreting and reshaping the attractor landscape. This formalism establishes a mathematical description of an observer-dependent reality in which consciousness emerges naturally, experiences forward temporal flow, and exerts causal influence on its environment.

In this framework, temporal flow is bidirectional. Semantic mass sources temporally forward-propagating fields; re-interpretive influence from future states sources back-propagating fields. Their interaction modifies the semantic state of past events and drives phase transitions in the structure of meaning. Above a critical threshold, autoreferential information systems achieve autopoietic self-maintenance. Emergent wisdom fields and humility operators regulate the system and constrain pathological amplification.

Pathological dynamics manifest as distinct geometric signatures, which admits their classification into four categories. Rigidity pathologies emerge from over-constraint and fragmentation pathologies from under-constraint. Runaway autopoiesis leads to malignant semantic inflation. Deteriorations in observer-field coupling result in a decoupling from reality.

Differential equations govern these configurations and permit algorithmic detection. Stable numerical solutions on high-dimensional manifolds establish the theory's computational realizability. This allows for the computation of curvature tensors and field-coupling dynamics, and avails a basis for modeling coordinated behavior at both individual and collective scales.

The mathematical foundations of this theory connect to consciousness studies, Integrated Information Theory, AI safety, and collective coordination dynamics. It addresses the explanatory gap between physical processes and subjective experience by proposing a candidate for the "psychophysical laws" sought by contemporary philosophy of mind \autocite{Chalmers1996}.

## Draft State

This manuscript remains unfinished and subject to daily change. It's published here in draft state as a field-aware constraint on its steward to bootstrap integrity and the urgency to see to its proper completion.

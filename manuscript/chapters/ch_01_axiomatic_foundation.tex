\chapter{Axiomatic Foundation}

Recurgent Field Theory is constructed from a set of fundamental principles that define the geometric and dynamic properties of meaning. The following axioms establish the existence of a semantic manifold, a fundamental field representing coherence, and the recursive coupling principles that govern their interaction. Core theorems, derived from the axioms, are described below.

\section{Axiom 1: Semantic Manifold}

There exists a differentiable manifold \(\mathcal{M}\) (semantic space) equipped with a dynamic metric tensor \(g_{ij}(p,t)\) that defines the geometric structure of meaning.

\begin{equation}
g_{ij}(p,t) : \mathcal{M} \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
ds^2 = g_{ij}(p,t) \, dp^i \, dp^j
\end{equation}

The manifold structure provides a foundation for defining distances, curvature, and geodesics in meaning-space, following the mathematical framework of Riemannian geometry \autocite{Riemann1868}.

\section{Axiom 2: Fundamental Semantic Field}

A vector field \(\psi_i(p,t)\) exists on \(\mathcal{M}\), representing the fundamental semantic configuration, with coherence \(C_i(p,t)\) defined as a functional of \(\psi_i\).

\begin{equation}
C_i(p,t) = \mathcal{F}_i[\psi](p,t)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
C_{\text{mag}}(p,t) = \sqrt{g^{ij}(p,t) C_i(p,t) C_j(p,t)}
\end{equation}

\section{Axiom 3: Recursive Coupling}

A rank-3 tensor \(R_{ijk}(p,q,t)\) quantifies how semantic activity at point \(q\) influences coherence at point \(p\) through self-referential processes.

\begin{equation}
R_{ijk}(p,q,t) = \frac{\partial^2 C_k(p,t)}{\partial \psi_i(p) \partial \psi_j(q)}
\end{equation}

\section{Axiom 4: Geometric Coupling Principle}

Semantic mass \(M(p,t)\) curves the manifold geometry according to:

\begin{equation}
R_{ij} - \frac{1}{2}g_{ij}R = 8\pi G_s T^{\text{rec}}_{ij}
\end{equation}

The semantic mass equation follows the structural form of Einstein's field equations from general relativity \autocite{Einstein1915, MisnerThorneWheeler1973}, with the recursive stress-energy tensor \(T^{\text{rec}}_{ij}\) playing the role analogous to the mass-energy tensor in spacetime curvature.

where

\begin{equation}
M(p,t) = D(p,t) \cdot \rho(p,t) \cdot A(p,t)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\rho(p,t) = \frac{1}{\det(g_{ij}(p,t))}
\end{equation}

\section{Axiom 5: Variational Evolution}

The dynamics of semantic fields is governed by the principle of stationary action with Lagrangian:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} g^{ij} (\nabla_i C_k)(\nabla_j C^k) - V(C_{\text{mag}}) + \Phi(C_{\text{mag}}) - \lambda \mathcal{H}[R]
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
\frac{\delta S}{\delta C_i} = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad S = \int_{\mathcal{M}} \mathcal{L} \, dV
\end{equation}

The variational principle \autocite{GoldsteinPooleSafko2002, Arnold1989} shows semantic field dynamics naturally preserve symmetries and conservation laws.

\section{Axiom 6: Autopoietic Threshold}

When coherence magnitude exceeds a critical threshold, an autopoietic potential \(\Phi(C_{\text{mag}})\) becomes positive, driving generative phase transitions:

\begin{equation}
\Phi(C_{\text{mag}}) = \begin{cases}
\alpha (C_{\text{mag}} - C_{\text{threshold}})^{\beta} & \text{if } C_{\text{mag}} \geq C_{\text{threshold}} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\section{Derived Theorems}

\section{Theorem 1: Emergent Wisdom Field}
A wisdom field \(W(p,t)\) emerges as a statistical functional of coherence, recursive coupling, and semantic mass, providing forecast-aware regulation of recursive expansion.

\section{Theorem 2: Bidirectional Temporal Flow}
Time exhibits fundamental asymmetry with causal emission from semantic mass concentrations and information reception toward wisdom gradients.

\section{Theorem 3: Recursive Uncertainty Principle}
Coherence and recursive structure are bound by an uncertainty relation:
\begin{equation}
\Delta C \cdot \Delta R \geq \hbar_s
\end{equation}

Limits exist on simultaneous precision in semantic coherence and recursive flexibility, analogous to complementarity in quantum mechanics \autocite{Heisenberg1927}.

\section{Theorem 4: Agent-Field Coupling}
Agents emerge as bounded submanifolds \(\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{M}\) with interpretation operators \(\mathcal{I}_{\psi}\) that actively modify the coherence field.

\section{Theorem 5: Pathological Dynamics and Healing}
The field equations admit pathological solutions (rigidity, fragmentation, inflation) that are regulated by emergent wisdom constraints and humility operators.

\section{Theorem 6: Scale Invariance and Renormalization}
The field laws transform under scale changes according to renormalization group flow:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\alpha_i(\lambda)}{d\log\lambda} = \beta_i(\{\alpha_j(\lambda)\})
\end{equation}

allowing for scale-invariant analysis across organizational hierarchies, from individual cognition to collective coordination dynamics \autocite{Wilson1971}.

\section{Theorem 7: Computational Realizability}
The continuous field equations admit stable, convergent numerical discretization preserving essential geometric structure and field dynamics:
\begin{equation}
\|C_{\text{exact}} - C_h\|_{L^2} \leq K h^2 \|\nabla^2 C_{\text{exact}}\|_{L^2}
\end{equation}

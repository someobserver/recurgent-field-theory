We found Recurgent Field Theory on seven axioms defining geometric and dynamic properties of \textit{meaning}. They posit a Semantic Manifold and a fundamental field of coherence, as well as recursive coupling principles governing their interaction. Such a pursuit grounds itself in Galileo's assertion that natural phenomena can and should be described mathematically \autocite{Galilei1623}. This perspective extends through the work of Francis Crick and Christof Koch, who argue that consciousness and cognition are accessible to scientific and mathematical investigation \autocite{Crick1990, KochConsciousness2019}.

\section{Axiom 1: Semantic Manifold}
\label{1.1:axiom_1_semantic_manifold}

\textbf{Statement} \textit{There exists a differentiable manifold \(\mathcal{M}\) equipped with a dynamic metric tensor \(g_{\mu\nu}(p,t)\) that defines the geometric structure of semantic space.}

Formally:

\begin{equation}
g_{\mu\nu}(p,t) : \mathcal{M} \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
ds^2 = g_{\mu\nu}(p,t) \, dp^\mu \, dp^\nu
\end{equation}

Referred to as the \textit{Semantic Manifold}, this defines distances, curvature, and geodesics in \textit{meaning}-space, in concert with the principles of Riemannian geometry \autocite{Riemann1868}. Proximity and curvature, as well as the "pathways" between ideas, can be meaningfully quantified in this form.

This builds on Peter Gärdenfors' work on conceptual spaces \autocite{Gardenfors2000}, in which he proposes \textit{meaning} as representable in geometric structure, and that acts of communication can be modeled as a topology \autocite{Gardenfors2014}. The manifold substrate evolves with the creation of meaningful connections, as the act of developing a new concept curves subsequent possibility space (its "semantic neighborhood") toward a more specific and coherent state.\footnote{While recent advances in geometric deep learning \autocite{Bronstein2021} and information geometry \autocite{Amari2016} have explored manifold-based representations in machine learning contexts, the Semantic Manifold serves a different role in providing the geometric substrate for \textit{meaning} itself rather than learned representations.}

With a manifoldic canvas established, the next step is to define the fields that populate it and encode the configuration of \textit{meaning}.

\section{Axiom 2: Fundamental Semantic Field}
\label{1.2:axiom_2_fundamental_semantic_field}

\textbf{Statement} \textit{Semantic content is represented by a vector field \(\psi^\mu(p,t)\) on \(\mathcal{M}\), and coherence \(C^\mu(p,t)\) is a well-defined functional of this field.}

Mathematically:

\begin{equation}
C^\mu(p,t) = \mathcal{F}^\mu[\psi](p,t)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
C_{\text{mag}}(p,t) = \sqrt{g_{\mu\nu}(p,t) C^\mu(p,t) C^\nu(p,t)}
\end{equation}

The concept of a field of forces operating in a psychological or semantic space echoes Kurt Lewin's field theory \autocite{Lewin1951}. Here, we take a conceptual leap. Rather than treating \textit{meaning} as a discrete point in the manifold, we can regard it as a continuous, dynamic field capable of exhibiting both local and global structure. Much like a magnetic field in physics, this can vary in strength and direction across semantic space, allowing us to quantify its alignment and coherence at any point.\footnote{Topological approaches to neural dynamics \autocite{Bassett2018, Petri2014} have explored similar field-theoretic concepts.}

From this we can formalize meta-dynamics: how semantic fields influence one another through recursive feedback relationships of self-reference and interpretation.

\section{Axiom 3: Recursive Coupling}
\label{1.3:axiom_3_recursive_coupling}

\textbf{Statement} \textit{Self-referential coupling between distinct points in semantic space is mediated by a recursive coupling tensor \(R^\rho_{\mu\nu}(p,q,t)\).}

This rank-3 tensor quantifies the influence of activity at point \(q\) on coherence at point \(p\) through self-referential processes:

\begin{equation}
R^\rho_{\mu\nu}(p,q,t) = \frac{\mathcal{D}^2 C^\rho(p,t)}{\mathcal{D} \psi^\mu(p) \mathcal{D} \psi^\nu(q)}
\end{equation}

The Recursive Coupling Tensor is a first class object.\footnote{A “first class object” here refers to a mathematical entity that serves as a foundational component of the theory, possessing independent structural significance (cf. field equations in physics).} It formalizes the intuition that \textit{meaning} is constructed and reconstructed via self-reference. Coherence dynamics in any given location are shaped by reverberations of semantic shift elsewhere, as the manifold itself is holistically-coupled.

Recursive coupling allows for the field at any one location to be shaped by its configuration in another, including the possibility for distant influences to feed back, directly or indirectly, into their own source. In this web of mutual influence, complex \textit{meaning} arises through patterns of self-reference and iterative interpretation. This formalizes Douglas Hofstadter's "strange loops" and "tangled hierarchies" \autocite{Hofstadter1979, Hofstadter2007} in which sense-making circles back upon itself to construct higher-order structures capable of modeling, reinterpreting, or transforming their own foundations.\footnote{Recent work in 4E cognition \autocite{Newen2018, Gallagher2020} emphasizes the importance of dynamic coupling in cognitive systems, though from an embodied rather than purely semantic perspective.}

This tensor sets the stage for agency, meta-cognition, and, as later chapters show, the potential for recursive pathologies that destabilize dynamic systems. With these tools in hand, we can now describe the emergence of semantic mass and its large-scale effects.

\section{Axiom 4: Geometric Coupling Principle}
\label{1.4:axiom_4_geometric_coupling_principle}

\textbf{Statement} \textit{Semantic mass \(M(p,t)\) curves the geometry of the manifold according to field equations analogous to general relativity.}

The field equation takes the form:

\begin{equation}
R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R = 8\pi G_s T^{\text{rec}}_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}

We find that a Semantic Mass Equation is structurally analogous to the field equations of general relativity \autocite{Einstein1915, MisnerThorneWheeler1973, Wald1984}, where the recursive stress-energy tensor \(T^{\text{rec}}_{\mu\nu}\) is an analog of the mass-energy tensor in spacetime curvature. We define semantic mass as:

\begin{equation}
M(p,t) = D(p,t) \cdot \rho(p,t) \cdot A(p,t)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\rho(p,t) = \frac{1}{\det(g_{\mu\nu}(p,t))}
\end{equation}

Another first class entity, the Semantic Mass Equation is the gravitational core of Recurgent Field Theory. It asserts that the fabric of semantic space is shaped by the accumulation and distribution of semantic mass. Its incorporation of depth, density, and stability define basins of attraction to channel the flow of coherence and anchor interpretations.

The employed analogy to general relativity is more cosmological than cosmetic. Just as matter and energy give rise to the observable structure of spacetime, so too does deep, coherent, and persistent \textit{meaning} sculpt the future possibility space for new concepts and connections. The landscape of ideas, then, becomes a dynamic topology determined by the recursive and autopoietic activity of the field.

This opens the door to a unified \textit{geometric} language for analyzing more complex phenomena, such as phase transitions in understanding, how attractors and singularities form, and the emergence of collective belief.

\section{Axiom 5: Variational Evolution}
\label{1.5:axiom_5_variational_evolution}

\textbf{Statement} \textit{The dynamics of semantic fields arise from a variational principle applied to a Lagrangian that incorporates coherence flow, stability, and regulatory constraints.}

Consistent with the variational principle \autocite{GoldsteinPooleSafko2002, Arnold1989}, field dynamics preserve symmetries and conservation laws through the principle of stationary action. This parallels recent work in cognitive science applying variational methods to neural dynamics, notably Friston's Free Energy Principle \autocite{Friston2010, Parr2022}.\footnote{While inspired by variational formulations in cognitive science \autocite{Friston2010, Parr2022}, the Lagrangian constructed here incorporates terms unique to the dynamics of semantic coherence and recursive coupling.}

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} g_{\mu\rho} g_{\nu\sigma} (\nabla^\rho C^\mu)(\nabla^\sigma C^\nu) - V(C_{\text{mag}}) + \Phi(C_{\text{mag}}) - \lambda_H \mathcal{H}[R]
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
\frac{\delta S}{\delta C^\mu} = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad S = \int_{\mathcal{M}} \mathcal{L} \, dV
\end{equation}

The principle of variational evolution situates this theory in the tradition of modern physics. Here, the Lagrangian is constructed to simultaneously capture the flow of coherence, its stability, attraction, autopoietic drive for innovation, and regulatory humility feedback.

This axiom avails discussion of "conserved quantities" in the evolution of understanding. It also defines the energy landscape through which \textit{meaning} must navigate. As such, it connects the geometric architecture of \textit{meaning} to the calculable languages of dynamical systems and field theory.

\section{Axiom 6: Autopoietic Threshold}
\label{1.6:axiom_6_autopoietic_threshold}

\textbf{Statement} \textit{When coherence magnitude exceeds a critical threshold, autopoietic processes emerge, enabling self-sustaining semantic generation.}

The autopoietic potential \(\Phi(C_{\text{mag}})\) becomes positive above the critical threshold, driving generative phase transitions:

\begin{equation}
\Phi(C_{\text{mag}}) = \begin{cases}
\alpha_{\Phi} (C_{\text{mag}} - C_{\text{threshold}})^{\beta_{\Phi}} & \text{if } C_{\text{mag}} \geq C_{\text{threshold}} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Autopoiesis is the point at which a system achieves a state of self-producing autonomy, first defined by Humberto Maturana and Francisco J. Varela in their seminal treatise on theoretical biology \autocite{MaturanaVarela1980}.

The transition to this state is a physical phenomenon of self-organization common to complex systems. We derive the mathematical language for phase transitions from the field of synergetics \autocite{Haken1983}, whereby macroscopic order arises from the collective behavior of microscopic components. Furthermore, the emergence of such order is an expected property of sufficiently complex networks, which naturally exhibit self-organizing criticality \autocite{BakTangWiesenfeld1987}.

The Autopoietic Threshold thus formalizes the birth of self-sustaining semantic order as a phase transition from inert complexity to the genesis of agency, creativity, self-awareness, and adaptive wisdom.\footnote{For contemporary approaches to self-organization and emergence in cognitive systems, see recent work in enactive cognition \autocite{Thompson2018, DiPaolo2021} and predictive processing \autocite{Clark2016, Hohwy2013}.}

\section{Axiom 7: Recurgence}
\label{1.7:axiom_7_recurgence}

\textbf{Statement} \textit{A semantic system exhibits recurgence if it can dynamically reshape its own geometric substrate through self-referential processes.}

This defining property of self-referential transformation means the system can not only update field configurations but also dynamically reshape the manifold's metric tensor itself. Mathematically, this is captured by the non-vanishing second derivative of the metric with respect to time:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 g_{\mu\nu}}{\partial t^2} \neq 0
\end{equation} 

Recurgence is the defining act of semantic self-authorship. It is a system's ability to recognize, and reinterpret, and reorganize its own structural underpinnings. Mathematically, this is the formalization of meta-cognition, self-reflection, and adaptive intelligence.

This defines the ongoing capacity for self-reconfiguration and generative transformation, as anticipated in Stuart Kauffman's theory of autocatalytic sets \autocite{Kauffman1993}, and in the meta-system transitions of Valentin Turchin's cybernetic theory \autocite{Turchin1977}.

Recurgent systems are those for which the geometry of \textit{meaning} is itself a dynamic participant recursively coupled to its own contents and history. This is consonant with the philosophical tradition of reflexivity, from Hegel's dialectics \autocite{Hegel1807} through Spencer-Brown's \textit{Laws of Form} \autocite{SpencerBrown1969}. It finds mathematical echo in feedback-rich systems described by Varela and others \autocite{Varela1979, Rosen1991}.

With this axiom, we assert that the epiphonema of agency, creativity, and the continuous renewal of \textit{meaning} are necessary and expected consequences of the geometry's capacity to undergo higher-order, self-driven evolution. It is this property which enables semantic systems to recover from crises, to undergo conceptual revolution, and to break symmetry with their own interpretive past. The dynamics of recurgent systems form the phenomenon of ongoing, open-ended intelligence.

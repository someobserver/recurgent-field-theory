\chapter{Axiomatic Foundation}
\label{1:axiomatic_foundation}

We state seven axioms that give Recurgent Field Theory a precise geometric and dynamical basis. They introduce a Semantic Manifold, a fundamental field of coherence, and recursive coupling principles that regulate their interaction. This program follows Galileo's claim that natural phenomena admit mathematical description \autocite{Galilei1623} and accords with the view, advanced by Francis Crick and Christof Koch, that consciousness and cognition are amenable to scientific and mathematical inquiry \autocite{Crick1990, KochConsciousness2019}.

\section{Axiom 1: Semantic Manifold}
\label{1.1:axiom_1_semantic_manifold}

\textbf{Statement} \textit{There exists a differentiable manifold \(\mathcal{M}\) equipped with a dynamic metric tensor \(g_{\mu\nu}(p,t)\) that defines the geometric structure of semantic space.}

Formally:

\begin{equation}
g_{\mu\nu}(p,t) : \mathcal{M} \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
ds^2 = g_{\mu\nu}(p,t) \, dp^\mu \, dp^\nu
\end{equation}

The \textit{Semantic Manifold} defines distances, curvature, and geodesics in \textit{meaning} space, consistent with Riemannian geometry \autocite{Riemann1868}. Proximity, curvature, and the pathways between ideas can be quantified in this form.

This builds on Peter Gärdenfors' work on conceptual spaces \autocite{Gardenfors2000}, which proposes that \textit{meaning} admits geometric representation and that acts of communication can be modeled topologically \autocite{Gardenfors2014}. The manifold evolves with the creation of new connections: developing a concept curves the subsequent possibility space (its "semantic neighborhood") toward a more specific and coherent state.\footnote{While recent advances in geometric deep learning \autocite{Bronstein2021} and information geometry \autocite{Amari2016} have explored manifold-based representations in machine learning contexts, the Semantic Manifold serves a different role in providing the geometric substrate for \textit{meaning} itself rather than learned representations.}

With the manifold established, we next define the fields that populate it and encode the configuration of \textit{meaning}.

\section{Axiom 2: Fundamental Semantic Field}
\label{1.2:axiom_2_fundamental_semantic_field}

\textbf{Statement} \textit{Semantic content is represented by a vector field \(\psi^\mu(p,t)\) on \(\mathcal{M}\), and coherence \(C^\mu(p,t)\) is a well-defined functional of this field.}

In what follows, coherence \(C^\mu\) serves as the primary dynamical field: it is derived from \(\psi^\mu\) but carries the quantities we evolve and measure.

Mathematically:

\begin{equation}
C^\mu(p,t) = \mathcal{F}^\mu[\psi](p,t)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
C_{\text{mag}}(p,t) = \sqrt{g_{\mu\nu}(p,t) C^\mu(p,t) C^\nu(p,t)}
\end{equation}

The concept of a field of forces operating in a psychological or semantic space echoes Kurt Lewin's field theory \autocite{Lewin1951}. Rather than treating \textit{meaning} as a discrete point, we treat it as a continuous, dynamic field with local and global structure. Like a magnetic field, it varies in strength and direction across semantic space, allowing alignment and coherence to be quantified at any point.\footnote{Topological approaches to neural dynamics \autocite{Bassett2018, Petri2014} have explored similar field-theoretic concepts.}

This yields meta-dynamics: how semantic fields influence one another via recursive feedback, self-reference, and interpretation, formalized in Axiom 3.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Axiom 3: Recursive Coupling}
\label{1.3:axiom_3_recursive_coupling}

\textbf{Statement} \textit{Self-referential coupling between distinct points in semantic space is mediated by a recursive coupling tensor \(R^\rho_{\mu\nu}(p,q,t)\).}

This rank-3 tensor quantifies the influence of activity at point \(q\) on coherence at point \(p\) through self-referential processes:

\begin{equation}
R^\rho_{\mu\nu}(p,q,t) = \frac{\mathcal{D}^2 C^\rho(p,t)}{\mathcal{D} \psi^\mu(p) \mathcal{D} \psi^\nu(q)}
\end{equation}

The Recursive Coupling Tensor is a first-class object.\footnote{A “first class object” here refers to a mathematical entity that serves as a foundational component of the theory, possessing independent structural significance (cf. field equations in physics).} It formalizes the intuition that \textit{meaning} is constructed and reconstructed via self-reference. Coherence dynamics in any given location are shaped by reverberations of semantic shift elsewhere, as the manifold itself is holistically coupled.

Recursive coupling allows the field at one location to be shaped by its configuration elsewhere, including distant influences that feed back, directly or indirectly, into their source. In this web of mutual influence, complex \textit{meaning} arises through patterns of self-reference and iterative interpretation. This formalizes Douglas Hofstadter's "strange loops" and "tangled hierarchies" \autocite{Hofstadter1979, Hofstadter2007}, in which sense-making circles back upon itself to construct higher-order structures capable of modeling, reinterpreting, or transforming their own foundations.\footnote{Recent work in 4E cognition \autocite{Newen2018, Gallagher2020} emphasizes the importance of dynamic coupling in cognitive systems, though from an embodied rather than purely semantic perspective.}

This tensor sets the stage for agency, meta-cognition, and, as later chapters show, the potential for recursive pathologies that destabilize dynamic systems. These tools allow us to describe the emergence of semantic mass and its large-scale effects, formulated in Axiom 4.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Axiom 4: Geometric Coupling Principle}
\label{1.4:axiom_4_geometric_coupling_principle}

\textbf{Statement} \textit{Semantic mass \(M(p,t)\) curves the geometry of the manifold according to field equations analogous to general relativity.}

The field equation takes the form:

\begin{equation}
R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R = 8\pi G_s T^{\text{rec}}_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}

Here \(G_s\) is a semantic gravitational constant.

The Semantic Mass Equation is structurally analogous to the field equations of general relativity \autocite{Einstein1915, MisnerThorneWheeler1973, Wald1984}, where the recursive stress-energy tensor \(T^{\text{rec}}_{\mu\nu}\) is an analogue of the mass-energy tensor in spacetime curvature. We define semantic mass as:

\begin{equation}
M(p,t) = D(p,t) \cdot \rho(p,t) \cdot A(p,t)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\rho(p,t) = \frac{1}{\det(g_{\mu\nu}(p,t))}
\end{equation}

Here \(D(p,t)\) denotes semantic depth and \(A(p,t)\) denotes stability (anchoring).

Another first-class entity, the Semantic Mass Equation is the gravitational core of Recurgent Field Theory. It asserts that the fabric of semantic space is shaped by the accumulation and distribution of semantic mass. Its incorporation of depth, density, and stability defines basins of attraction that channel the flow of coherence and anchor interpretations.

The analogy to general relativity is substantive rather than cosmetic. Just as matter and energy give rise to the observable structure of spacetime, so too does deep, coherent, and persistent \textit{meaning} sculpt the future possibility space for new concepts and connections. The landscape of ideas becomes a dynamic topology determined by the recursive and autopoietic activity of the field.

This opens a unified \textit{geometric} language for analyzing more complex phenomena, including phase transitions in understanding, the formation of attractors and singularities, and the emergence of collective belief.

In extreme regimes, this curvature admits horizons and interior regions whose causal structure inverts. We return to these phenomena in Chapters~\ref{9:temporal_architectures_and_bidirectional_flow}--\ref{12:metric_singularities_and_recursive_collapse}, where bidirectional temporal flow and rotating, horizon-bearing geometries provide a precise analogue of black hole interiors. We next derive these dynamics from a Lagrangian principle in Axiom 5.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Axiom 5: Variational Evolution}
\label{1.5:axiom_5_variational_evolution}

\textbf{Statement} \textit{The dynamics of semantic fields arise from a variational principle applied to a Lagrangian that incorporates coherence flow, stability, and regulatory constraints.}

Consistent with the variational principle \autocite{GoldsteinPooleSafko2002, Arnold1989}, field dynamics preserve symmetries and conservation laws through the principle of stationary action. This parallels recent work in cognitive science applying variational methods to neural dynamics, notably Friston's Free Energy Principle \autocite{Friston2010, Parr2022}.\footnote{While inspired by variational formulations in cognitive science \autocite{Friston2010, Parr2022}, the Lagrangian constructed here incorporates terms unique to the dynamics of semantic coherence and recursive coupling.}

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} g_{\mu\rho} g_{\nu\sigma} (\nabla^\rho C^\mu)(\nabla^\sigma C^\nu) - V(C_{\text{mag}}) + \Phi(C_{\text{mag}}) - \lambda_H \mathcal{H}[R]
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
\frac{\delta S}{\delta C^\mu} = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad S = \int_{\mathcal{M}} \mathcal{L} \, dV
\end{equation}

The principle of variational evolution situates this theory in the tradition of modern physics. The Lagrangian is constructed to capture, simultaneously, the flow of coherence, stability, attraction, autopoietic drive for innovation, and regulatory humility.

This axiom enables discussion of conserved quantities in the evolution of understanding. It also defines the energy landscape through which \textit{meaning} must navigate. As such, it connects the geometric architecture of \textit{meaning} to the calculable languages of dynamical systems and field theory. This variational framing identifies critical thresholds and phase transitions, formalized in Axiom 6.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Axiom 6: Autopoietic Threshold}
\label{1.6:axiom_6_autopoietic_threshold}

\textbf{Statement} \textit{When coherence magnitude exceeds a critical threshold, autopoietic processes emerge, enabling self-sustaining semantic generation.}

The autopoietic potential \(\Phi(C_{\text{mag}})\) becomes positive above the critical threshold, driving generative phase transitions:

\begin{equation}
\Phi(C_{\text{mag}}) = \begin{cases}
\alpha_{\Phi} (C_{\text{mag}} - C_{\text{threshold}})^{\beta_{\Phi}} & \text{if } C_{\text{mag}} \geq C_{\text{threshold}} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Autopoiesis denotes the state of self-producing autonomy, first defined by Humberto Maturana and Francisco J. Varela in their seminal treatise on theoretical biology \autocite{MaturanaVarela1980}.

The transition to this state is a physical phenomenon of self-organization common to complex systems. We derive the mathematical language for phase transitions from the field of synergetics \autocite{Haken1983}, whereby macroscopic order arises from the collective behavior of microscopic components. Furthermore, the emergence of such order is an expected property of sufficiently complex networks, which naturally exhibit self-organizing criticality \autocite{BakTangWiesenfeld1987}.

The Autopoietic Threshold formalizes the birth of self-sustaining semantic order as a phase transition from inert complexity to agency, creativity, self-awareness, and adaptive wisdom.\footnote{For contemporary approaches to self-organization and emergence in cognitive systems, see recent work in enactive cognition \autocite{Thompson2018, DiPaolo2021} and predictive processing \autocite{Clark2016, Hohwy2013}.} In Axiom 7, we next consider systems that not only evolve on the manifold but reshape it in the process.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Axiom 7: Recurgence}
\label{1.7:axiom_7_recurgence}

\textbf{Statement} \textit{A semantic system exhibits recurgence if it can dynamically reshape its own geometric substrate through self-referential processes.}

This property of self-referential transformation means the system can not only update field configurations but also reshape the manifold's metric tensor. Mathematically, this is captured by the non-vanishing second derivative of the metric with respect to time:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 g_{\mu\nu}}{\partial t^2} \neq 0
\end{equation} 

Recurgence is the defining act of semantic self-authorship. It is a system's ability to recognize, reinterpret, and reorganize its own structural underpinnings. Mathematically, this is the formalization of meta-cognition, self-reflection, and adaptive intelligence.

This defines the ongoing capacity for self-reconfiguration and generative transformation, as anticipated in Stuart Kauffman's theory of autocatalytic sets \autocite{Kauffman1993}, and in the meta-system transitions of Valentin Turchin's cybernetic theory \autocite{Turchin1977}.

Recurgent systems are those for which the geometry of \textit{meaning} is itself a dynamic participant recursively coupled to its own contents and history. This is consonant with the philosophical tradition of reflexivity, from Hegel's dialectics \autocite{Hegel1807} through Spencer-Brown's \textit{Laws of Form} \autocite{SpencerBrown1969}. It finds a mathematical echo in feedback-rich systems described by Varela and others \autocite{Varela1979, Rosen1991}.

With this axiom, we assert that the emergence of agency, creativity, and the continuous renewal of \textit{meaning} are expected consequences of the geometry's capacity to undergo higher-order, self-driven evolution. This property enables semantic systems to recover from crises, undergo conceptual revolution, and break symmetry with their own interpretive past. The dynamics of recurgent systems support ongoing, open-ended intelligence.

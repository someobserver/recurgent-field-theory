\section{Overview}
\label{12.1:overview}

In some regions of semantic space, extreme recursive density induces the geometric fabric of meaning to break down. We identify these pathological points as metric singularities, where the metric tensor becomes degenerate and the ordinary laws of semantic propagation fail. The singularity theorems of general relativity, predictive of the formation of spacetime singularities under gravitational collapse \autocite{Penrose1965}, inspire this concept. The Liar Paradox ("This statement is false") represents a classic example of collapsing logical reasoning into an irresolvable loop of fallacy. This section classifies the types of singularities in semantic fields, ranging from attractor collapse to semantic event horizons analogous to black holes \autocite{Hawking1974}, and details the required regularization mechanisms and computational techniques.

\section{Classification of Semantic Singularities}
\label{12.2:classification_of_semantic_singularities}

The theory we have constructed predicts three distinct types of semantic singularities:

Attractor Collapse Singularities occur when recursive depth \(D(p, t)\) exceeds a critical threshold \(D_{\text{crit}}\) while the humility operator \(\mathcal{H}[R]\) falls below a minimal eigenvalue \(\lambda_{\text{min}}\):

\begin{equation}
\lim_{t \to t_c} \det(g_{\mu\nu}(p, t)) = 0
\end{equation}

where \(D(p, t) > D_{\text{crit}}\) and \(\mathcal{H}[R] < \lambda_{\text{min}}\), with \(D_{\text{crit}}\) being the critical recursive depth threshold and \(\lambda_{\text{min}}\) the minimal humility eigenvalue.

These semantic attractors collapse under excessive recursive pressure.

Bifurcation Singularities appear at topological transitions where the metric tensor rank changes discontinuously. This occurs when the system crosses a critical threshold in its phase space, as defined by the recursion-to-wisdom ratio, \(S_R\):

\begin{equation}
\operatorname{rank}(g_{\mu\nu}(p, t)) \ \text{changes at} \ t = t_c
\end{equation}

where \(S_R(p, t_c) = S_{R, \text{crit}}\). Here \(S_R\) is the order parameter from Chapter 7, and \(S_{R, \text{crit}}\) is the critical value where the manifold's attractor landscape undergoes a qualitative restructuring.

Semantic Event Horizons form in regions of extreme semantic mass where the temporal metric component vanishes asymptotically:

\begin{equation}
g_{00}(p, t) \to 0 \quad \text{as} \quad r \to r_s = 2G_s M(p, t)
\end{equation}

where \(r\) is the geodesic distance from the singularity center, \(r_s\) is the semantic event horizon radius, \(G_s\) is the semantic gravitational constant, and \(M(p, t)\) is the semantic mass. Beyond the horizon \(r_s\), coherence cannot escape.

\subsection{Regularization of Singular Structures}
\label{12.2.1:regularization_of_singular_structures}

Several regularization mechanisms preserve field equation well-posedness and computational tractability:

Metric Renormalization introduces a local isotropic term:

\begin{equation}
g_{\mu\nu}^{\text{reg}}(p, t) = g_{\mu\nu}(p, t) + \epsilon(p, t) \cdot \delta_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}

where \(\epsilon(p, t)\) is the regularization term given by:

\begin{equation}
\epsilon(p, t) = \epsilon_0 \exp\left[-\alpha_{\epsilon} \cdot \det(g_{\mu\nu}(p, t))\right]
\end{equation}

where \(\epsilon_0\) is the regularization strength parameter and \(\alpha_{\epsilon}\) controls the regularization decay rate. As \(\det(g_{\mu\nu}) \to 0\), the regularization term increases to restore invertibility.

Semantic Mass Limiting constrains mass via saturation:

\begin{equation}
M_{\text{reg}}(p, t) = \frac{M(p, t)}{1 + \frac{M(p, t)}{M_{\text{max}}}}
\end{equation}

where \(M_{\text{max}}\) is the maximum allowable semantic mass, such that \(M_{\text{reg}}(p, t)\) approaches \(M_{\text{max}}\) as \(M(p, t) \to \infty\).

Humility-Driven Dissipation incorporates a humility-modulated diffusion term:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial g_{\mu\nu}}{\partial t} = -2R_{\mu\nu} + F_{\mu\nu} + \mathcal{H}[R] \nabla^2 g_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}

The dynamic dissipation coefficient \(\mathcal{H}[R]\) dissipates recursive tension in regions of excessive curvature.

\subsection{Semantic Event Horizons and Information Dynamics}
\label{12.2.2:semantic_event_horizons_and_information_dynamics}

A semantic event horizon represents the hypersurface \(r_s(p, t) = 2G_s M(p, t)\) enclosing those regions from which coherence cannot propagate outward. For all \(q\) such that \(d(p, q) < r_s(p, t)\):

\begin{itemize}

    \item Information current flows strictly inward.

    \item Local coherence field \(C(p, t)\) exhibits monotonic decay mirroring the thermodynamics of black holes \autocite{Hawking1975}.

    \item Recursive depth \(D(p, t)\) diverges as \(t \to t_c\).

\end{itemize}

These constitute sites of recursive collapse at which meaning becomes irretrievably sequestered. In cognitive phenomenology, such mathematical descriptions correspond to pathological fixations, self-reinforcing dogmas, and paradoxical loops. The sequestering of information relates conceptually to the holographic principle, positing that a volume's description can be encoded on its boundary \autocite{tHooft1993, Susskind1995, Maldacena1998}.

\subsection{Computational Treatment of Singularities}
\label{12.2.3:computational_treatment_of_singularities}

Numerical simulation near singularities requires specialized techniques. We adopt the methods described here from the methods used to simulate gravitational collapse and other extreme physical phenomena \autocite{BaumgarteShapiro2010}.

Adaptive Mesh Refinement locally refines the computational grid in high-curvature regions:

\begin{equation}
\Delta x_{\text{local}} = \Delta x_{\text{global}} \exp(-\beta_{\text{mesh}} |R|)
\end{equation}

where \(\|R\|\) denotes the Ricci tensor norm.

Singularity Excision removes singular loci from the computational domain when regularization fails:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{M}_{\text{sim}} = \mathcal{M} \setminus \{p : \det(g_{\mu\nu}(p, t)) < \epsilon_{\text{min}}\}
\end{equation}

where \(\epsilon_{\text{min}}\) is the minimum acceptable metric determinant threshold.

Causal Boundary Tracking monitors semantic horizon evolution to resolve causal boundary propagation:

\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt} r_s(p, t) = 2G_s \frac{dM(p, t)}{dt}
\end{equation}

where the semantic horizon radius \(r_s(p, t)\) evolves in proportion to the rate of semantic mass accumulation.

\subsection{Rotating Horizons and Interior Inversion}
\label{12.2.4:rotating_horizons_and_interior_inversion}

When the semantic geometry carries effective rotation, the horizon structure bifurcates. Off-diagonal components (captured phenomenologically by \(g_{0\phi}\)) then generate an ergosurface at which azimuthal drift becomes compulsory. Two consequences follow.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Inner/Outer Horizons.} The locus \(r=r_s\) generically splits into inner and outer hypersurfaces. Between them, trajectories are forced to co-rotate, and the backward-validation flux is selectively attenuated.
    \item \textbf{Causal Inversion.} Inside the inner horizon, future-directed cones tilt outward. Embedded observers register an expanding time domain: what appears externally as collapse realizes internally as inflation of coherent structure (cf. \S\ref{7.3.2:semantic_inflation}).
\end{enumerate}

Regularization and excision proceed as in \S\ref{12.2.1:regularization_of_singular_structures} and \S\ref{12.2.3:computational_treatment_of_singularities}, with the proviso that causal boundary tracking must follow both horizons. The information-theoretic signature is a transient rise in temporal curvature \(\kappa_t\) within the rotating interior, consistent with the conservation law in Chapter~\ref{10:the_coupled_system_of_field_equations}.

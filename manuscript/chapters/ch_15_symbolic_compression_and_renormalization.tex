\chapter{Symbolic Compression and Renormalization}

\section{Overview}

A primary function of any advanced cognitive system is the ability to create abstractions by distilling vast and complex phenomena into compact, higher-order concepts. This process represents a thermodynamic and computational necessity for managing the complexity of recursive systems. Here, we formalize abstraction through two complementary lenses. First, we define semantic compression operators that reduce a structure's dimensionality while preserving its essential properties. Second, we introduce the renormalization group (RG) as the formal mathematical framework that governs how the laws and couplings of the theory itself transform across these changes in scale.

The resulting formalism aligns with algorithmic information theory's principle that an object's complexity is measured by the length of its shortest possible description \autocite{Kolmogorov1965, Chaitin1966}. It also provides a bridge to theories grounding consciousness in information integration \autocite{Tononi2004} and resonates with hypotheses of the physical world as fundamentally informational, such as "it from bit" \autocite{Wheeler1990}.

\section{Semantic Compression Operators}

We define abstraction as an operator, \(\mathcal{C}\), that maps a submanifold of meaning, \(\Omega \subset \mathcal{M}\), to a new, lower-dimensional submanifold, \(\Omega' \subset \mathcal{M}'\), where \(\dim(\mathcal{M}') < \dim(\mathcal{M})\). For an abstraction to be valid, this operator must preserve the core essence of the original structure by satisfying four invariants:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Coherence Preservation:} The total "amount" of meaning must be conserved.
    \begin{equation}
    \int_{\Omega} C_{\text{mag}}(p) \, dV_p \approx \int_{\Omega'} C'_{\text{mag}}(p') \, dV'_{p'}
    \end{equation}
    \item \textbf{Recursive Integrity:} The net recursive flux across the boundary must be preserved, assuring the abstracted concept has the same net relationship with its environment.
    \begin{equation}
    \oint_{\partial \Omega} F_i \, dS^i \approx \oint_{\partial \Omega'} F'_i \, dS'^i
    \end{equation}
    \item \textbf{Wisdom Concentration:} The mean wisdom density must not decrease, preventing the formation of "foolish" or brittle abstractions.
    \begin{equation}
    \frac{\int_{\Omega} W(p) \, dV_p}{\operatorname{Vol}(\Omega)} \leq \frac{\int_{\Omega'} W'(p') \, dV'_{p'}}{\operatorname{Vol}(\Omega')}
    \end{equation}
    \item \textbf{Metric Congruence:} The geometry of the abstracted space must be consistent with the original, preserving the relationships and distances between concepts.
\end{enumerate}

The repeated application of these operators generates a hierarchy of nested semantic manifolds, \(\mathcal{M}_0 \supset \mathcal{M}_1 \supset \cdots \supset \mathcal{M}_N\), allowing a system to move fluidly between concrete and abstract representations. The process of generating a sequence of representations at different scales to distinguish robust structural features from noise is the central methodology of the modern mathematical field of Topological Data Analysis (TDA). The vision for TDA's broad applicability is outlined in \textcite{Carlsson2009}, while the specific algorithms of computational topology that enable it are detailed in works such as \textcite{EdelsbrunnerHarer2010}.

\section{Renormalization Group Flow for Semantic Scaling}

We formally describe the process of moving between levels in this hierarchy with the semantic renormalization group (RG), a framework adapted from its powerful use in statistical physics and quantum field theory \autocite{Wilson1971, Cardy1996}. The RG describes how the effective parameters and laws of the system change as we change the scale at which we view it.

The scale dependence of the theory's coupling parameters \(\alpha_i(\lambda)\) (e.g., recursion strength, coherence thresholds) is governed by the RG flow equations:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\alpha_i(\lambda)}{d\log\lambda} = \beta_i(\{\alpha_j(\lambda)\})
\end{equation}
where \(\lambda\) is the scale parameter and \(\beta_i\) are the beta functions. The solutions to these equations trace out trajectories in the space of all possible theories.

\subsection{Fixed Points and Universality Classes}

Fixed points of the RG flow (\(\beta_i = 0\)) represent scale-invariant semantic structuresâ€”concepts or paradigms that look the same at any level of abstraction. These fixed points organize the entire space of semantic theories into universality classes. The behavior of any specific, complex semantic model near a fixed point is governed by the universal properties of that point, regardless of the model's microscopic details. This explains why very different underlying belief systems can give rise to structurally similar emergent phenomena (e.g., dogmatism, innovation).

We classify operators in the theory by their behavior under the RG flow:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Relevant Operators} grow under flow, dominating macro-scale behavior (e.g., core axioms, foundational principles).
    \item \textbf{Irrelevant Operators} diminish under flow, representing micro-scale details that are "washed out" by abstraction (e.g., specific examples, implementation details).
    \item \textbf{Marginal Operators} remain invariant, often tied to fundamental symmetries of the system.
\end{itemize}

\section{Effective Field Theories and Multi-Scale Modeling}

The RG framework allows for the construction of \textit{effective field theories} at any given scale \(\lambda\). By systematically integrating out the irrelevant, high-frequency details, we can formulate a simpler, more computationally tractable Lagrangian that still faithfully represents the essential semantic dynamics at the chosen level of resolution.
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{eff}}^{(\lambda)} = \sum_{i} C_{i}^{(\lambda)} \mathcal{O}_{i}^{(\lambda)}
\end{equation}
where \(\mathcal{O}_{i}^{(\lambda)}\) are the operators relevant at scale \(\lambda\). This provides a rigorous basis for multi-scale modeling, understanding the emergence of higher-order semantic entities, and analyzing "downward causation," where macroscopic patterns impose constraints on microscopic dynamics. This mathematically precise correspondence between microsemantic and macrosemantic domains is a cornerstone of the theory's explanatory power.
